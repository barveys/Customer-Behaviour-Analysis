Data Analysis Project – End-to-End Analytics Pipeline
1 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow — from raw data processing to interactive dashboard reporting.
The objective of the project was to:
•	Load and analyze a dataset using Python
•	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning
•	Store and query data using PostgreSQL
•	Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI
•	Create a structured analytical report
•	Prepare a presentation using Gamma
This project highlights strong skills in data analysis, SQL, data visualization, and business reporting.
